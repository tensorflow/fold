  A Loom builds a TensorFlow graph which can be made to emulate any
  graph made from the `LoomOps` passed in via the `named_ops` argument, tensors
  passed in via the `named_tensors`, and constants (created at runtime, along
  with the graphs the Loom is to emulate.)

  After creating a Loom object (see `Loom.__init__`), you can connect its
  outputs to a larger TensorFlow graph by getting its `output_tensor` to get the
  batch tensor containing all outputs of a certain shape from Loom, and then
  call arbitrary further TensorFlow ops on that (Loom is also fully compatible
  with gradients privided the LoomOps it was constructed with are.)

  At runtime, you can construct an emulated graph by calling the
  `Loom.make_weaver` method and using the resulting Weaver object's API to
  build up a graph. To run the emulated graph you can then call the Weaver's
  build_feed_dict method to get a dictionary that can be passed to
  TensorFlow's `Tensor.eval` or `Session.run` methods.

  ##### Batch input mode

    In batch input mode, Loom reads inputs from a batched input tensor (which
    will contain a batch of elements of the appropriate TypeShape) instead of
    from constants passed in via Weaver.  The main advantage is that is that
    inputs fed in via batch input mode can be backpropagated through, unlike
    constants.  Batch input mode can be turned on on a per TypeShape basis,
    given a tensor which will contain a batch of elements of the right
    TypeShape.  If a TypeShape is put into batch input mode, then, when using
    the Weaver, instead of manually declaring constants you can simply refer to
    elemements of the batch by index.  Additional advantages of using batch
    input mode are that bulky constants need not bloat the weaver messages and
    they may be changed at runtime.

  ##### Bypass modes

    Loom can bypass python graph specification should it become a bottle-neck.
    If the `Loom` is constructed with an `input_tensor`, that input tensor
    should contain serialized `WeaverMessages` (which specify a graph or
    schedule for the `Loom` to execute.  See loom.proto for the definition.)
    This `input_tensor` might, for example, read pre-computed `WeaverMessages`
    from a TF-Record file, or pull them from a Tensorflow queue (which would
    allow the computation of schedules to be parallelized across multiple
    processes.)

    Alternatively, if you want all scheduling to happen at runtime in C++ you
    can subclass `WeaverOpBase` (see `weaver_op_base.h`).  The Loom's
    constructor should then be given a `weaver_op`, a function which will be
    passed Loom's metadata and instantiate the user's custom op.

  ##### `direct_feed_dict` mode
    Loom can also be run in direct_feed_dict mode.  This bypasses
    DeserializingWeaverOp (a TensorFlow op which turns serialized
    `WeaverMessages` in a string tensor into the sorts of tensors that can drive
    the Loom), copying constant tensors directly into the feed_dict, and
    extracting the wiring vectors directly into the feed_dict.  This mode is
    useful for evaluating the cost of DeserializingWeaverOp.  `direct_feed_dict`
    mode is not compatible with the bypass modes above because it avoids putting
    any of its schedules into a string tensor as a `WeaverMessage` entirely.

  ##### Implementation details

    ![wiring diagram](wiring.png)

    A Loom object wraps a sequence of loom layers each of which can be directed
    to perform a variety of operations. In order to carry a variety of types at
    runtime, the connections from one loom layer to the next include one state
    Tensor containing a batch of values of each supported TypeShape. (E.g. if
    float32 vectors of length 3 are supported, there will be a float32 Tensor
    with dimensions (*, 3) to carry 3-vectors from each layer to the next.)

    Each layer has three sub-layers: (1) an input demultiplexer that extracts
    arguments from the input state tensors and routes them to sub-layer 2 (using
    tf.gather.)  (See weaver.h for the scheduling code that transforms a graph
    of loom operations into lists of indices for these gather ops.) (2) a
    collection of TensorFlow subnetworks, one for each operation type supported
    by the Loom.  These are instantiated with LoomOp.instantiate_batch using the
    inputs from sub-layer 1.  (3) an output multiplexer that combines the
    outputs of the LoomOps (using tf.concat) to form the state tensors to be
    passed on to sub-layer 1 of the next Unit.

    (See `Loom._construct_loom_layer` for the implementation.)

    By default, `max_depth` is unspecified and Loom wraps a single loom layer in
    a `tf.while_loop`.  If max_depth is specified, loom unrolls the loop by
    instantiating `max_depth` copies the loom layer.

    """Constructs a Loom.

    While this constructor has many arguments, the only arguments most users
    will care about are `named_ops`, `named_tensors`, `dry_run`,
    `loom_input_tensor` and possibly `weaver_op`.

    To create a Loom object, the only mandatory argument is `named_ops` (a
    dictionary mapping strings to `LoomOps`) specifying the collection of
    operations the Loom should support.

    Specifiying `named_tensors` allows the `Loom` to construct graphs that refer
    to the provided TensorFlow tensors.  The advantage of using a named tensor
    instead of a Loom constant is that the named tensor can be backpropped
    through.

    Specifying `loom_input_tensor` causes the `Loom` to read its schedules
    (`WeaverMessages`) from external sources.  Specifying `weaver_op` allows
    `Loom` to compute them on the fly in C++.  See the class docstring section
    named "Bypass Modes" for the motivation for this feature.

    Specifying `dry_run` creates the Loom without constructing the associated
    TensorFlow graph.  This is useful when the loom is only going to be used to
    construct `WeaverMessages` to drive another instance of the same loom.

    Args:
      max_depth: An optional integer depth to unroll the generic network to.  If
        absent, Loom uses a `tf.while_loop`.  `max_depth` is provided for
        compatibility with old versions of TensorFlow with bad support for
        `tf.while_loop` and for debugging purposes.
      named_tensors: An optional dictionary mapping strings to Tensors. (Named
        tensors are effectively zero argument LoomOps.)  Each value of
        `named_tensors` must be either a tf.Tensor or a tuple of the form
        (tf.Tensor, str) with the string specifying a TypeShape tag.
      named_ops: A mandatory dictionary mapping strings to LoomOp objects (the
        set of operations the Loom should support.)
      batch_inputs: An optional dictionary mapping TypeShapes to Tensors.  Each
        Tensor in the dictionary should have the type and shape to contain a
        batch of things of that TypeShape stacked along dimension 0.
      extra_type_shapes: An optional iterable containing extra TypeShapes that
        may not be inputs or outputs of LoomOps but that the Loom should support
        anyway.
      dry_run: Boolean. If true, don't build the TensorFlow graph (and make the
        output tensors be dummy constants.)  This is useful for rapid testing in
        situtions where building the TensorFlow graph is expensive (eg. large
        max_depth) or when the objective is to construct schedules and serialize
        them as `WeaverMessages` for later use.
      parallel_iterations: Integer. tf.while_loop's parallel_iterations option,
        which caps the number of different depths at which ops could run in
        parallel.  Only applies when max_depth=None. Default: 10.
      back_prop: Boolean. tf.while_loop's back_prop option, which enables
        gradients. Only applies when max_depth=None.  Default: True.
      swap_memory: Boolean. Whether to use tf.while_loop's swap_memory option,
        which enables swapping memory between GPU and CPU at the possible
        expense of some performance. Only applies when max_depth=None. Default:
        False.
      direct_feed_dict: Boolean. If true, this loom doesn't create a loom_input
        tensor for WeaverMessages, and instead creates placeholders for the
        wiring diagrams. Default: False.
      loom_input_tensor: An optional string Tensor from which to read
        WeaverMessages which specify how to wire the loom.  If more than one is
        present they will be merged (auto-merge is provided so that
        WeaverMessages for individual inputs can be cached in advance while
        still using random mini-batches at run-time.)  Mutally exclusive with
        `weaver_op`.
      weaver_op: An optional callable which constructs a TensorFlow op to
        produce inputs for the loom.  Mutually exclusive with
        `loom_input_tensor`.  If absent, the loom acts as though `weaver_op`
        were a function creating a `deserializing_weaver` op which consumes
        `WeaverMessages` from `loom_input_tensor`.  The callable will be called
        with three keyword arguments named `metadata`, `constant_types`, and
        `num_type_shapes` (because these are the three attributes any op
        descending from `WeaverOpBase` requires to be instantiated.)

    Raises:
      TypeError: If `named_ops` is not provided.
      TypeError: If more than one tagged TypeShape has the same tag.
